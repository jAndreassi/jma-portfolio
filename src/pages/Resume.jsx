        github.com/jAndreassi After spending a decade as a retail manager, I
        decided to take a coding bootcamp to pursue a new career path in the
        tech industry. The bootcamp provided me with the skills and knowledge
        necessary to become a competent programmer, and I'm now eager to put
        these skills to use in a new role. While the transition may seem like a
        big leap, I believe that my years of experience as a manager have
        equipped me with transferable skills such as communication,
        problem-solving, and teamwork, which will be valuable in any workplace.
        I'm excited to explore the possibilities that the tech industry has to
        offer and eager to start my new journey as a developer. SKILLS •
